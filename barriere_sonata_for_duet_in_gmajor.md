[^4]: In chaconne form, particularly in the French Baroque style, a Refrain refers to the continuously repeating bass line or chord progression (the ostinato) that forms the structural backbone of the piece. The 4-measure excerpt repeats twice, making the total 8 measures, which serves as the refrain of this piece.
[^5]: Couplets are the contrasting variations or episodes that appear between repetitions of this Refrain. They introduce melodic, rhythmic, or harmonic changes, offering diversity and developing the musical ideas while remaining rooted in the underlying bass pattern.
